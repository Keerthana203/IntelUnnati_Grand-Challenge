# Accident Location Analysis & Enhancing Road Safety

## Project Overview
This project focuses on improving road safety by analyzing accident-prone locations using advanced data analysis and geospatial tools. By leveraging real-time alerts, hospital proximity data, and ambulance services, we aim to enhance emergency response times, thereby reducing accident-related fatalities.

## The project integrates datasets related to:
+ Vehicle alerts (Forward Collision Warning, Pedestrian Collision Warning, etc.)
+ Road networks
+ Traffic conditions
+ Hospital and ambulance locations
+ Key Objectives
+ Accident Prone Location Detection: Using geospatial analysis to identify high-risk accident zones.
+ Emergency Response Optimization: Calculating the shortest path to nearby hospitals using Dijkstra's algorithm.
+ Ambulance Service Integration: Optimizing response time by integrating local ambulance data.
  
## Data Sources
+ Intel Corporation datasets for vehicle alerts and road conditions.
+ Hospital and Ambulance Services data in Chennai, Chengalpattu, and Kanchipuram near NH 32.
+ Geospatial data visualized using QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) and Kepler GIS.
  
## Features
+ Real-Time Alerts: Analysis of alerts like Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Pedestrian Collision Warning (PCW), and Headway Monitoring Warning (HMW).
+ Geospatial Mapping: Visualizing accident hotspots and nearby hospital locations.
+ Speed & Alert Type Correlation: Identifying patterns based on vehicle speed and type of alert.
+ Shortest Path Calculation: Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the fastest route to the nearest hospital.
+ Ambulance Integration: Mapping of ambulance services to improve response times in emergencies.
  
## Technologies Used
+ QGIS: For mapping accident locations and plotting hospitals and ambulance routes.
+ Kepler GIS: For detailed geospatial data visualization.
+ Dijkstra's Algorithm: To compute the shortest path for ambulances to reach hospitals.
+ Machine Learning: Analyzing and visualizing accident data.
  
## Key Insights
+ Accident Hotspots: Identified accident-prone areas that require targeted interventions.
+ Alert Patterns: Headway Monitoring Warning (HMW) alerts are the most frequent, highlighting the importance of driver focus on maintaining safe distances.
+ Response Time Optimization: Enhanced hospital routing and ambulance dispatch times in accident situations.
